Wildfly remediation with Event Driven Ansible
====

This project contains the source code and the slideck of the presentation and demo performed for the second edition of the Wildfly Mini Conf on the 20th November 2024.

The slidedeck uses [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides), to display them as they were during the event run the following command:

    $ slides slides.md

To reproduce the demo, use a fresh VM with RHEL9 (or equivalent) or a Podman container based on UBI9 with systemd enabled and then run the setup-container.sh script.

The demo can most likely be run on other distribution, such as Fedora or Ubuntu, but the installation of Event Driven Ansible may need to be adapted.
