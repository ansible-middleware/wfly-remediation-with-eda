# Last time, on Wildfly Mini Conf...

* We saw how to install Wildfly in fully automated fashion using **Ansible**.
* What is Ansible?
    * An Open Source, python based and crossplatform automation solution
    * No code, but YAML descriptor:
```yml
- name: "An Ansible playbook to setup SSHd"
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    sshd_pkg_name: openssh-server
  tasks:
    - name: "Ensure {{ sshd_pkg_name }} is installed"
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: "{{ sshd_pkg_name }}"
        state: present
    - name: "Ensure service is running"
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: sshd
        state: running
```

# Going further... Event-Driven Ansible!

## The power of automation
* Now, we have an **automation infrastructure** that will keep our deployment in the proprer **state**
* Let's leverage this to implements **remediation** using **Event-Driven Ansible** (EDA)

## What is EDA?
* one
* two
* three

# Demo 1 - Restart Wildfly is server is down

* Let's write a simple **rulebook** to leverage Event Driven Ansible (EDA) to automatically restart Wildfly if it's no longer running...

* (simple use case, but we do need to start somewhere...)

```

# Demo 2 - Restart on Java Out of Memory!

* Restarting Wildfly if it's down is nice, but we can do far more than that.
* Historically, Java apps were sometimes plagued by out of memory errors, that required a restart
* Let's implement a **remediation strategy**, using EDA, for this common problem

# Demo 3 - Flush db connection if the app reports idle connection
* An app has a bug leading to leave some db connection idled
* The bug has not yet been identified (or the fix is not released)
* An easy fix is to flush the idle db pool when the problem is detected
* Let's implement that remediation strategy with EDA
---
# Demo 4 - Undeploy a broken app
* An app can be broken and when it is, it has to be removed
* And unregister from the web balancer (not in the demo)
* Wildfly state must check after app removal

# Thanks!
